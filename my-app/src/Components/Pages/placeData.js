It was established in the 16th century to commemorate the visit of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, in 1521. According to Sikh tradition, a miracle occurred here when a local saint named Wali Qandhari, who lived atop a nearby hill, refused water to Guru Nanak’s followers. When Guru Nanak requested water, he caused a spring to flow from a rock at the base of the hill. Enraged, Wali Qandhari hurled a large boulder down towards Guru Nanak, who stopped it effortlessly with his hand. The impression of his hand (panja) miraculously appeared on the stone, which became the central relic of the site. This event is remembered as a powerful symbol of Guru Nanak’s divinity, compassion, and power.",
